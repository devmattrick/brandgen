# BrandGen
BrandGen is a very simple CLI-based program used to help find names for companies of projects. It does this by
providing a set of tools to help you find the perfect name. The benefit of using BrandGen over websites like GoDaddy or
similar is that it ensures your name won't get stolen out from under you, as all queries are made directly to the
services themselves and not through a websie that may be logging your queries. It also allows for more flexibility and
extensibility than most existing services can provide.

## Checkers
A checker checks a specific service if a name is available. BrandGen comes out of the box with a number of checkers for
common services.

### Domain
Checks for domain name availability. By default checks for `.com`, `.org`, `.net`, and `.io`, but can be configured to check for any TLD.

### Twitter
Checks for Twitter username availability.

### GitHub
Checks for GitHub user/ organization name availability.

### Instagram
Checks for Instagram username availability.
